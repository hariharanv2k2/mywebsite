        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            A crawler-based search engine is a type of search engine that uses automated bots, known as web crawlers, to systematically browse the web and index the content they find. This indexed content is then used to provide relevant search results to users.
        </p>

        <h2>Software Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your choice</li>
            <li>Python latest version</li>
            <li>Mysql 8.0.28</li>
            <li>Flask(Web Application Framework)</li>
            <li>Pymysql 1.0.3</li>
            <li>Beautifulsoup4 4.12.2</li>
            <li>Requests 2.29.0</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The search engine crawler starts by visiting a list of URLs, often referred to as the seed URLs. From these initial pages, it follows links to other pages, systematically covering the web to build a comprehensive index of content. This process includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fetching web pages</li>
            <li>Parsing the content of the web pages</li>
            <li>Following links to other pages</li>
            <li>Storing the retrieved content in an index</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The crawler continues this process, periodically revisiting pages to ensure the index remains up-to-date.
        </p>
