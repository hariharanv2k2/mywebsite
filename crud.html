        <p class="lead">
            A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is one of the most fundamental applications that you can build. It's a basic requirement for any web application to have functionality that allows users to create, view, modify, and delete data.
        </p>

        <h2>Components of the Application</h2>
        <p>
            This CRUD application is built using the following technologies:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python:</strong> The main programming language used to write the backend logic.</li>
            <li><strong>Flask:</strong> A lightweight web framework for Python that provides the necessary tools to develop a web application.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL:</strong> A popular relational database management system used to store the application's data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding CRUD Operations</h2>
        <p>
            CRUD operations are the four basic functions that any application should be able to perform:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create:</strong> Add new data to the database. In this application, users can add new entries to a table in the MySQL database.</li>
            <li><strong>Read:</strong> Retrieve and display data from the database. This operation allows users to view the data stored in the database.</li>
            <li><strong>Update:</strong> Modify existing data in the database. Users can edit and save changes to the existing data.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove data from the database. Users can delete data they no longer need.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            This application is designed to manage a simple list of users. It allows you to add a new user, display all users, edit user details, and delete users. Below is a summary of how these operations are implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flask Routes:</strong> Flask routes are used to define the various endpoints for the CRUD operations. For example, the route <code>@app.route('/add_user', methods=['POST'])</code> handles adding a new user.</li>
            <li><strong>MySQL Database:</strong> The user data is stored in a MySQL database. The application connects to the database using Flask-MySQLdb and executes SQL queries to perform CRUD operations.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML Templates:</strong> The user interface is built using HTML templates that are rendered by Flask. These templates display the user data and provide forms for adding and editing users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
            If you're interested in building this application, the next step is to set up your environment by installing the necessary libraries (Flask and Flask-MySQLdb) and creating the MySQL database. Once your environment is ready, you can write the Flask application code and start implementing the CRUD operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a detailed step-by-step guide on building this CRUD application, refer to the official Flask documentation and MySQL tutorials.
